1. Project Overview

Game Title: Mememory

Brief Description:

Mememory is a 2-player, turn-based card-matching game where all cards contain meme images. Players take turns flipping two cards at a time to find matching pairs. Each turn is limited to 15 seconds, making the game fast and competitive.
Game Objectives & Win/Lose Conditions:
Objective: Match as many pairs of meme cards as possible before the board is cleared.
Win Condition: The player with the most matched pairs at the end of the game wins.


Lose Condition:
If a player ends with fewer matched pairs than the opponent, they lose.

Gameplay Notes:
Matching gives you +1 point and lets you keep your turn.
A mismatch flips cards back and automatically switches the turn.
